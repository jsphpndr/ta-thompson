Thomas Alvin Thompson                             
was born on February 4th, 1889 at Hope Town, Abaco. 
At age 12 he became a monitor at the Hope Town Public School. In 1907 he travelled to Nassau for a student teacher's examination and placed first. Between 1908 - 1909 he was appointed a student teacher and was sent to The Boys Central School, Nassau for training. He was later appointed as an Assistant to Mr. Wallace Thompson, headmaster, of the Victoria School. In 1909 he was given the position of acting master of the Public School in Green Turtle Cay, Abaco where he later became headmaster. He was appointed second master in 1914 to the Boys' Central School, Nassau, after which he took the local teacher's examination and obtained a first class certificate. In 1917 he became headmaster of the Boys' Central School.
During the summer of 1934 Mr. Thompson was chosen to represent The Bahamas in a Summer Seminar at Yale University in the United States of America. His report from the seminar led to his appointment as assistant Inspector of Schools in 1938. 
During the latter part of 1939 he became a registered member of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene. He published a book entitled A Short Geography of The Bahamas. In 1948 he was given the title of Companion of the Imperial Service Order by H. M. King George. A year later he retired.
In 1952 he came out of retirement when he accepted a post as accountant to the Labour Office. Two years later he was employed as an accountant and statistician by the Development Board. In 1965 Mr. Thompson suffered a heart attack and retired from work permanently. He died in Nassau on April 20, 1966 at the age of seventy-seven.
T. A. Thompson Primary School was named in his honour. It was located where C. R. Walker Senior High now stands.  In 2008 C. C. Sweeting Junior High School was renamed T. A. Thompson Junior High School in his honour..

This includes: Girls - white blouse (lt. blue for prefects), plaid skirt (below the knee), 1 pair of blue socks, crest, tie and black shoes; Blue, black or gray jacket/sweater.

6. Manage Your Time
Scan through the test quickly before starting. Answering the easy questions first can be a time saver and a confidence builder. Plus, it saves more time in the end for you to focus on the hard stuff. 

7. I'm Stuck!
Those tricky problems can knock you off balance. Don't get worried or frustrated. Reread the question to make sure you understand it, and then try to solve it the best way you know how. If you're still stuck, circle it and move on. You can come back to it later. What if you have no idea about the answer? Review your options and make the best guess you can, but only if you don't lose points for wrong answers. 

8. Multiple-Choice Questions
The process of elimination can help you choose the correct answer in a multiple-choice question. Start by crossing off the answers that couldn't be right. Then spend your time focusing on the possible correct choices before selecting your answer. 

9. Neatness Counts
If your 4s look like 9s, it could be a problem. Be sure that your writing is legible and that you erase your mistakes. For machine-scored tests, fill in the spaces carefully. 

10. I'm Done! 
Not so fast - when you complete the last item on the test, remember that you're not done yet. First, check the clock and go back to review your answers, making sure that you didn't make any careless mistakes (such as putting the right answer in the wrong place or skipping a question). Spend the last remaining minutes going over the hardest problems before you turn in your test. 

Follow these test tips, and you'll know that you did your best.
              

                                            GOOD LUCK!
